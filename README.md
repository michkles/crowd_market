# CrowdMarket

##The Concept

The idea of CrowdMarket is quite simple. It's a cross of social media site and e-commerce platform. As a user you can create posts, like and unlike them or add new friends - just like any social network website. Imagine that you are a seller and want to sell your items through posts of CrowdMarket's users. If you want to see how we made it happen look at the pictures below.
